Travis CI can automatically deploy files to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
after a successful build.

For a minimal configuration, add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: netlify
  site: <site>
  auth: <auth>
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

{% include deploy/providers/netlify.md %}

## Deploying a specific directory

To deploy a specific directory, use the `local_dir` key:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: netlify
  # â‹®
  local_dir: "_build/"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

{% include deploy/shared.md %}
