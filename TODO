- rewrite openshift
- bitballoon -> netlify drop
- pages: fix keep_history

- check: Cargo will refuse to publish crates from a dirty working directory
- check: Deploy to a S3 hosted website
- check: Custom Heroku commands do not affect the Travis CI build status

- generate "Shared Options"
- consider removing `run` from all providers except Heroku and Engine Yard
- add a shared note about --cleanup
- normalize and extract talking about secrets and settings
- normalize dasherized options to underscored options
- normalize placeholder values to <username> or <encrypted password>

- for package/registry providers restore the note that they'll probably want to use tags
- discuss what to do with the "easy way" travis.rb setup

- add AWS CloudFormation
- add Convox
- add Gleis

Style:

* besides the `provider` option, do not repeat options that have been discussed
  in previous examples, only add options relevant to the example
* use `# â‹®`, not `# ...`
* use `access_key_id: <access_key_id>` for denoting key value pairs
* do not quote values that are not required to be quoted as per YAML
* use underscored option names, not dasherized option names
