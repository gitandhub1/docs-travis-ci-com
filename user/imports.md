title: Importing shared build configuration

layout: en
---

The main source of configuration for your build is the `.travis.yml` file stored in your repository. Now you can import up to five configuration snippets into your `.travis.yml`, so you can update multiple repositories making only one change.

> Configuration imports is currently in beta. 
{: .beta }

## Example

Instead of specifying which versions of Ruby to test against in multiple files, you can define them in a snippet:

```yaml
rvm:
  - 2.5
  - 2.6
```
{: data-file="rubies.yml"}

You can then `import` that snippet into your `.travis.yml`. The following configuration imports the file `rubies.yml` from the `main` branch of the `shared-configs` repository of the `travis-ci` account:

```yaml
import: travis-ci/shared-configs/rubies.yml@main
script: bundle exec rake
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Resulting in the following configuration:

```yaml
rvm:
  - 2.5
  - 2.6
script: bundle exec rake
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Import key

You can import up to 5 YAML sources/snippets into one `.travis.yml`, and you can of course reuse those snippets in multiple repositories.

The format of the `import` source is `<account>/<repository>/<path>@<ref>` in whic `<ref>` can be any valid Git reference, such as a commit sha, branch name, or tag name. If you do not specify `<ref>`, Travis CI will fetch the latest version of the master branch in the repository.

> Public repositories can import sources from public repositories, but not private repositories. Private repositories can import sources from both public and private repositories.

Import a single snippet:

```yaml
#import a single file
import: travis-ci/build-configs/rubies.yml@main
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Import multiple snippets:

```yaml
# import multiple files
import:
  - travis-ci/build-configs/rubies.yml@adf1235
  - travis-ci/build-configs/other.yml@v1
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

By default, if the same keys are present in multiple imported snippets, they are overwritten with the last configuration imported. But you can also specify [deep_merge](#merge-mode).

## Merge mode

The default merge `mode` is `merge` which performs a shallow merge.
This means that root level sections (keys) defined in your `.travis.yml` will be overwritten by root level sections (keys) that are also present in the imported yaml file.
Merge modes are specific to each source.

You can also use `deep_merge` and `replace`:

* `deep_merge` merges sections (keys) that hold maps recursively.

* `replace` is used only in API requests. TODO:

```yaml

# shallow merge - this one is the default if no merge mode is specified
- source: travis-ci/shared-config/hola.yml@main
  mode: merge

#
- source: travis-ci/shared-configs/other.yml@main
  mode: deep_merge
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}


## Importing configurations from the same repository

When importing configurations stored in the same repository as your `travis.yml`, you can ommit the `<account>/<repository>` and use only the path:

```yaml
# local imports fetch the same git commit ref
import:
- ./one.yml
- ./other.yml
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

By default, configurations imported from the same repository, fetch the commit youâ€™re currently building. This is intended to help while you are  creating and testing the shared configurations.
